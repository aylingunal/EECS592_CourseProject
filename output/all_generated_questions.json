A serving of 1/4 teaspoon will provide approixmately 3 mg of iodine, or 20 times the RDA. Is that safe? Dr. David Brownstein, MD, thinks so. He regularly prescribes 6-12 mg of iodine as a maintenance dose, and up to 50 mg to \"load\" the body until it reaches sufficiency and excretes 90%. In his book, \"Iodine, Why You Need It\", he carefully analyzes and disproves the seven common concers with using iodine above the RDA, showing in case after case history that the whole body benefits while safely excreting excess iodine in the urine. We also know Asian cultures with high consumption of seafood and seaweed, average well above 150 mcg of iodine per day and show no ill effects, with markedly longer lifespans. If you are concerned about too much iodine, please consult your health practitioner. Otherwise, enjoy the wealth of nutrition this kelp brings you from the deep Atlantic.

Starting the day with a balanced, great-tasting breakfast can put you on the fast track to good nutrition and better overall health. While many kids and adults forget this important first meal, research has shown that sitting down for a nutritious breakfast can decrease the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other nutritionally related conditions in kids and adults. Kids who eat breakfast: <ul><li>Are more alert in school, with better concentration, memory and grades<li>Get more fiber, calcium, vitamins A and C, riboflavin, zinc, and iron to help build stronger bodies<li>Have more energy to pursue healthy and active lifestyles</ul> Coming ready to eat out of the box without extra mess and cooking, cereal is a cornerstone of the busy American family's diet. Kellogg's fortified cereals offer a low-fat, nutrient-dense, cholesterol-free food that encourages breakfast consumption. Studies have found that children who consume breakfast cereal have a higher intake of essential vitamins and minerals including iron, calcium, and B and D vitamins. Beyond the nutrients in the cereal itself, a serving of cereal is an excellent centerpiece for a balanced breakfast that includes fruit and milk. Children and adults alike enjoy the variety, flavors, and textures of cereal. Families benefit from the opportunity to sit down and eat as a family with a convenient, easy-to-serve food. Kellogg Company is a leading producer of cereal and convenience foods--a company you can rely on for great-tasting, high quality foods. Kellogg was founded in 1906, in Battle Creek, Michigan. For more than 100 years, innovation and their commitment to being the best has guided the company. From being the first company to offer premiums in cereal boxes to being the first to fortify the cereals, Kellogg has historically been a leader in industry, innovation, and marketing. The founder, W.K. Kellogg, had a strong commitment to nutrition, health, and quality. His vision continues to drive improvement in the products and processes, with the goal of providing great-tasting, nutritious products that meet the most rigorous quality standards. With more than 100 ready-to-eat cereals around the world, consumers count on Kellogg for great-tasting, convenient, and affordable choices that meet their nutrition needs. In the late 1800s at the Battle Creek Sanatorium, a combination hospital and health spa for the elite and famous, W.K. Kellogg, business manager, and his brother, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, chief physician, were in the process of cooking some wheat for a type of granola when they were called away. When they returned, the wheat had become stale. They decided to force the tempered grain through the rollers anyway, and surprisingly, the grain did not come out in long sheets of dough. Instead each wheat berry was flattened and came out as a thin flake. This led to the formation of the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company in 1906, which eventually became Kellogg Company--changing the form of breakfast forever. The company that makes breakfast and snacks for millions began with only 44 employees. Today, Kellogg employs more than 25,000 people, manufactures in 17 countries, and sells its products in more than 180 countries. Kellogg is the worlds leading producer of cereal and a leading producer of convenience foods, including cookies, crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars, frozen waffles, and meat alternatives. The companys brands include Kelloggs, Keebler, Pop-Tarts, Eggo, Cheez-It, Club, Nutri-Grain, Rice Krispies, All-Bran, Special K, Mini-Wheats, Chips Deluxe, Sandies, Morningstar Farms, Famous Amos, and Kashi.

So take a departure from the ordinary snack experience and enjoy a gratifying treat. Youll be glad you did! Garden of Eatin' was founded almost 35 years ago by Al Jacobson, a visionary who was always several steps ahead of his contemporaries. He first toyed with the idea of becoming a vegetarian in the early 1900s when as a toddler living on a farm in Pennsylvania, he discovered the family ate his favorite playmate, the chicken! Fast-forward to the 1940s when he dabbled in yoga and metaphysics and became a traveling product demonstrator for Hain Pure Foods, an organic company on the West Coast. In the early 1970s, Al let his spiritual side guide him to start his own health food company--Garden of Eatin with the launch of Bible Bread, organic whole wheat pita. Then in 1986, after he followed his natural health instincts and purchased tons of organic blue corn, Al decided to produce Blue Corn Chips. In keeping with his unorthodox approach, the chips were launched at a major fancy foods show and they took off! Since then, Garden of Eatin has introduced more than 20 varieties of all-natural tortilla chips, each of them true to Als inspiring outlook on life and healthy snacks. In 1998, Garden of Eatin became a part of The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., a natural and organic foods company \"Dedicated to a Healthy Way of Life.\" Since then, Garden of Eatin has expanded its product line into several new categories including: Organic Taco Shells and Taco Dinner Kits; Organic Microwave Popcorn; Pita Chips; and Toasted Corn Nuts.

Unlike other oils on the market, Nutivas Virgin Coconut Oil is never refined, deodorized or bleached. At Nutiva, we start with organic, non-GMO Southeast Asian coconuts, sustainably harvested and immediately cold pressed to naturally extract the freshest, creamiest, most flavorful coconut oil on the market today. The rich aroma and smooth, sweet flavor make it great for sauting, baking, or enhancing your favorite recipes. It's ideal as a medium-heat cooking oil, a nutritious substitute in baking and is even \"better than butter\" on bread, vegetables or popcorn. Nutivas Virgin Coconut Oil is a healthful addition to vegetarian, vegan, raw, whole food, paleo, ketogenic, and gluten-free diets. The purity and nutrient density of Nutivas Virgin Coconut Oil make it good for you both inside and out. Use the luscious, soothing oil as a natural skin moisturizer, eye make-up remover, deep conditioning hair treatment, or combine it with Nutiva Coconut Sugar and your favorite essential oil for an exfoliating, refreshing body scrub. Nutiva was founded in 1999 with a single purpose in mind - to Revolutionize the Way the World Eats. Our role is to produce and promote organic, nutrient dense superfoods that are good for you and good for the planet. Social and environmental responsibility is a core part of Nutivas culture and business. From sourcing organic products, to obtaining fair trade certification, to greening our facilities and operations, to funding tree planting at schools in our local community, we are constantly seeking ways to better protect our environment and ensure a better quality of life for employees, customers, and the communities we serve. Nutiva began in 1999 as an idea in the mind of John W. Roulac, the author of four books on home composting and industrial hemp. Nutiva is the third successful business John has founded since jump-starting the modern home-composting movement in the early 1990s with his best-selling book, <i>Backyard Composting</i>. That book has sold more than a million copies worldwide. <table align=center width=100 cellpadding=10> <tr> <td> <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/grocery/detail-page/nutiva_header1.gif\" border=0 align=top><br><br></td></tr></table> <table align=center width=100 cellpadding=10> <tr> <td> <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/grocery/detail-page/nutiva_johnmug_lake.jpg\" border=0 align=top><br><br></td></tr></table> <b>Nutiva is an innovative leader in the health food industry.</b> Since 1999, we have operated as a values-driven company dedicated to nourishing people and planet. <b>We're building a business characterized by high standards</b> in all aspects of our company, from the organic farms that grow our foods, through the production, packaging, and transportation of our products, to the Nutiva associates who communicate with our retailers and the people who enjoy our products. <b>Our watchwords--nutritious superfoods, healthier people, and a sustainable planet</b>--express our commitment to move beyond conventional food industry practices to embrace a bigger picture that supports the long-term well-being of humanity as a whole. <b>Nutiva's purpose is to produce the highest-quality organic superfoods,</b> providing superior nutritional value to our customers while supporting sustainable agricultural practices and a fair return to the farmers on whom we depend. We donate 1% of our sales to groups that promote sustainable agriculture. <b>We educate people worldwide</b> on current developments in nutritional science, organic farming, green energy, and fair trade practices within the global economy. <b>At Nutiva, we continually innovate</b> so that we can better contribute to the health and happiness of our customers as well as the sustainability of our planet. <table align=center width=100 cellpadding=10> <tr> <td> <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/grocery/detail-page/nutiva_header2.gif\" border=0 align=top><br><br></td></tr></table> Hemp was cultivated in China more than 6,000 years ago, from a wild plant that grew in central Asia. <b>A Nutritional Powerhouse</b><br> Hempseed is considered by leading researchers and medical doctors to be one of the most nutritious food sources on the planet. Shelled hempseed is packed with 33% pure digestible protein and is rich in iron and vitamin E as well as omega-3 and GLA. A recent report funded by the Canadian government states that hemp protein comprises 66% high-quality edistin protein, and that hempseed contains the highest percentage of this of any plant source. Unlike soy, hemp is not genetically modified, and it doesn't contain the anti-nutritional qualities commonly found in soy. <b>Got Your EFAs today?</b><br> Because the human body produces no Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs), it is important that EFAs be consumed on a regular basis. It is estimated that more than 90% of Americans take in too little of one of the most important EFAs--omega-3--which is found in flax, walnuts, deep-water fish, and hempseeds. EFAs are the \"good fats\" that doctors recommend as part of a healthy, balanced diet. The quality of omega-3 is vital, and can be diminished by oxygen, heat, and light. Thus consume the freshest seeds possible and store them in a dark, cold environment such as a refrigerator. Nutiva obtains its seeds exclusively from Canada, and we date all our products. Great nutrition never tasted so good. No refrigeration required; solid at room temperature and melts at 76 degrees F 100% Organic, Unrefined, Cold-Pressed, Virgin Coconut Oil No refrigeration required. Coconut oil is solid at room temperature and melts at 76 degrees, with a smoke point of 350 degrees. Pleasenote that there is NO difference between Virgin and Extra-Virgin Coconut Oil. We previously used the term 'extra-virgin'to emphasize our commitment to quality, however, as a leader in coconut oil, Nutiva is committed to complying with global regulations that do not allow the term 'extra-virgin'in regard to coconut. When you see the term Virgin on our packaging, rest assured that the product is still the highest quality and has not changed.

Today, we are exposed to increasing levels of harmful environmental pollutants, smoke, caffeine, food toxins, etc. More than twenty potent Chinese purification herbs have been used to create our Detox Tea. Traditionally, these herbs were used to support the healthy function of the liver, kidneys, lungs and blood, and to cleanse the body of toxins. They were considered to help promote clear, healthy skin, increase the flow of energy (chi) to the body and mind, and promote calmer, more positive and peaceful emotions. Treat yourself to our delicious and effective revitalizing tea on a regular basis. Make periodic cleansings and daily purification a normal part of your regime. Traditional Chinese medicine began in approximately 2500 B.C. Recently, here in the West, people have discovered the value of this ancient system which focuses on aiding the body's own healing mechanisms through restoring harmony and balance. The Chinese system of herbology has been recorded in ancient texts which are studied and employed even today. This time tested knowledge has been passed on from generation to generation over the centuries. Triple Leaf Tea comes from such a tradition. It is made in the U.S.A. by a Chinese American family-owned business. The company owner can remember stories of his own grandfather selling herbs and teas in his village in China.

Xylitol is a natural low-glycemic sweetener, manufactured from birch trees, corn, or other natural xylan-rich sources. It is metabolized independently of insulin and is safe for diabetes or anyone seeking a healthier life-style. Xylitol is not only a safe, natural sweetener without the bad side-effects of sugar and artificial substitutes, it's also good for your teeth, stabilizes insulin and hormone levels, and promotes good health. Our sugar free Frappe mix is blended with pure pharmaceutical grade Xylitol. Pure Xylitol is a white crystalline substance that looks and tastes like sugar. On food labels, xylitol is classified broadly as a carbohydrate and more narrowly as a polyol. Because xylitol is only slowly absorbed and partially utilized, a reduced calorie claim is allowed: 2.4 calories per gram or 40% less than other carbohydrates. Xylitol is a natural sweetener found in many fruits and vegetables. Dental and medical professionals use xylitol worldwide since it's been clinically proven to fight cavities and reduce plaque. Xylitol tastes like sugar with 1/3 fewer calories. It is recommended for people with diabetes and hypoglycemia because it has a low glycemic index of 7. Xylitol also inhibits the metabolic process of cavity causing bacteria. Whether you're looking for a low calorie sweetener an alternative to sugar for those with diabetes or hypoglycemia or better dental health Xylitol is a great tasting solution.",

Air and moisture stay out. <b>The Bigelow&reg; Tea Story</b> Beginning the moment our founder, Ruth Campbell Bigelow created \"Constant Comment\"&reg; Tea in her kitchen in 1945, our family has focused on just one thingtrying to make the finest teas possible. Over the years we have introduced many new flavors as well as concepts in tea. Today we offer a selection of deliciously different blends of teas and green teas, a wide variety of herbal teas and teas flavored with real fruit juice. Today Bigelow Tea is the number one specialty tea company in the United States. And to think it all began with the first legendary black tea flavored with golden orange rind and sweet spice\"Constant Comment\"&reg;Tea. Bigelow takes immense pride in providing the tea drinking community with the best tea at a great value. We only use hand- picked teas, real spices, flavors and herbs. The flavors and blends we have created are second to none. Some of our teas contain up to twenty different ingredients! And because tea is a leaf that can dry out we take steps to protect it. To keep the teas fresh, we seal our tea bags in protective packets. We simply have to protect those delightful flavors. Thats why a cup of Bigelow Tea is aromatic and delicious; a true indulgence for the senses.

This ensured a more consistent quality because, as with any crop, the characteristics of a consignment can vary according to climate, time of year and general growing conditions. In 1930 PG Tips was launched in the UK as a loose leaf tea in soft packs. It was originally called Pre-Gest-Tee\" but soon abbreviated by grocers and van salesmen as PG. The company adopted the official name and added 'tips' to highlight that PG takes only the top two leaves and a bud to make its tea. PG Tips is a popular British blend of the finest Assam, Ceylon and Kenyan teas which produces a rich and refreshing flavor. The definitive traditional English tea. The PG Tips pyramid tea bag gives the tea leaves more room to move around than a flat conventional tea bag. So the tea bag works like a miniature tea pot. This allows for all the freshness to be released for the best tasting cup of PG. <div class=\"aplus\" style=\"font-family:Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:18px;\"> <img hspace=20 border=0 width=276 height=600 src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/grocery/detail-page/unilever/SE9140_LiptonPGTips_LargeSign5_276x600._V146188818_.jpg\" alt=\"LIPTON&reg; Pyramid Teas\" align=\"right\"> <b> <div style=\"font-family:Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;\">A Smashing Cup of Tea</b></div> <span style=\"font-family:Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;\"><b>The PG Tips Story</span> <table cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5> <tbody> <tr> <td valign=top><img border=0 width=500 height=245 src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/grocery/detail-page/unilever/SE9140_LiptonPGTip_GroceryFOC-4-500x245._V146189037_.jpg\" alt=\"LIPTON&reg; Pyramid Teas\" align=\"right\"></td> <td><span style=\"font-family:Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;\"><b>Tea and Health Facts</b></span><span style=\"font-family:Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:18px;\"><ul><li>Scientific studies have linked drinking tea to the maintenance of certain normal healthy body functions, such as hydration, focus, and alertness.</li><li>Tea naturally contains zero calories, therefore, when it is used in place of higher calorie beverages as part of a healthy diet, it can help with weight control.</li><li>In addition, regular tea drinking may help maintain cardiovascular health as part of a diet that is consistent with dietary guidelines.</li> <li>Research suggests that drinking 2 to 3 cups per day of black or green tea helps maintain healthy blood vessel function.</li></ul></span></td> </tr> </tbody> </table>",

        "description": "A staple of Thai, Indian and Caribbean cuisines, Native Forest Classic Organic Coconut Milk imparts rich and creamy goodness to wonderful regional dishes. In Thailand, devoted farmers are proud to have achieved organic certification of their traditional coconut crop. While organic coconuts are generally smaller than their conventional counterparts, organically managed trees are more robust and drought-resistant, and their soil is more rich and moisture retentive. The first pressing of the fresh organic coconut meat yields an oil-rich extract that is mixed only with filtered water and a tiny amount (less than 1%) of guar gum from the seeds of the guar plant. The result is Native Forest Classic Organic Coconut Milk, a delicious ingredient in soups, curries, sauces, desserts, and beverages. It may also replace dairy milk or cream in some of your favorite American recipes with excellent results. Certified Organic Coconut Milk (organic coconut, water, organic guar gum). Store at room temperature and shake well before using. Once opened, refrigerate and use within 4 days. Product may to separate when its temperature falls below 80 degrees F. This makes the milk appear curdled as the coconut fat separates from the liquid. Such separation is harmless and easily remedied by placing the can of coconut milk in hot water for 15 minutes and then stirring the contents thoroughly.

The tea powder is rich in green tea polyphenois, catechins, chlorophyll, vitamins: C, E, B1, B2, carotene & proteins. Excellent quality and suitable to drink regularly. \n\nMatcha is a green tea powder made from the leaves of tea trees grown in the shade and then lightly steamed to prevent fermentation and loss of antioxidants. High-grade matcha is made in limited amounts , harvested only once a year in the Spring. The benefits of match green tea powder make it a healthy and tasty alternative to traditional green tea.\n\nHowever, our company just recently realized that there is an amazing difference in the quality of green tea. If you carefully look at most matcha green teas, they are not green, they are brown. After some research, we found that the best green tea is really bright green tea. If it isnt bright green, you are receiving inferior oxidized green tea which will not provide the full range of benefits youve heard about. \n\nAll Green Teas Are Not Created Equal \n\nMatcha, a powdered green tea, comes from the same plant as black teas, but remains unfermented. It is then ground into a fine green powder so that you receive benefits from the entire tea leaf.\n\nEver Wonder Why the Japanese Enjoy Such a Long Life Expectancy?\n\nInterestingly enough, after water, green tea happens to be the most widely consumed beverage on earth. For centuries, Matcha green tea has been kept a guarded secret. Why? The Japanese desired to keep their tea ceremony very exclusive and closed to the outside world. Plus, the people of Japan wanted to keep this scarce form of green tea with its numerous health-promoting benefits strictly to themselves. \n\nWith the powerful health-supporting benefits of green tea, and even more so with Matcha, I believe that 127 million Japanese have the right idea.

It is easy to picture this tree on the cliffs of Moterrey ,the wind blowing and ocean spray below.Tree is in an 6\" pot. \nJapanese Dwarf Juniper - Juniperus procumbens nana\n\n\n\nThis juniper has a low, spreading habit that makes it ideal for cascade and semi-cascade styles. Specimens grown in a nursery or specifically for bonsai can be used for many styles.\n\nLighting: Full sun.\n\nTemperature: Tolerates a wide range of temperatures, including freezing, however, roots must be protcted from excessive heat or cold.\n\nWatering: Spray the foliage with water daily during the growing season. Water when the soil is moderately dry (to a depth of 1/2 to 1 inch) but do not let the soil dry out completely.\nPruning and wiring: To develop the foliage, pinch out the tender new shoots using your fingers. Do not use scissors, as the cut needles will turn brown. Pinching must be done continuously during the growing season. Prune undesirable branches (especially those growing straight down from their parent branch) when repotting or during the growing season.\n\nWiring is best done in autumn or early winter, so that the branches can become accustomed to their new position while the tree is dormant. Wiring done at other times must be watched carefully for signs of wire cutting into the bark, and must be removed immediately if this happens. If necessary, the tree can be re-wired after removing the old wire.\nRepotting Reduce the roots gradually, removing no more than one third of the roots at each repotting. Repot young trees (up to 10 years) every other year. Repot older trees every 3-4 years. Repotting is best done in spring. Be sure to use Hollow Creek Farms Double Screened Bonsai Soil and Micro Plus when repotting.

Arico's exotic all-natural Cassava Chips are 30-40% less fat and twice the fiber of the leading potato chip. Chips that you can jump head first into because they're light, crispy, and free of artificial ingredients and preservatives. Go on an exotic holiday with Thai Ginger Crisproot Chips! This inspired ginger-lemongrass flavor will take you on a whole new adventure!  With their own humble beginnings, founders Hermanto Hidajat and Angela Ichwan founded Arico Natural Foods in 2004 with a big dream  to make a positive difference in the world. The inspiration came from Angelas niece, Ella, who is Autistic & lives gluten- and dairy-free. Their travels also revealed to them that there are very few products out there for food-allergy sufferers that dont also compromise taste and nutrition. After working at Fortune 100 companies and for leaders in the global food industry, Angela and Hermanto decided to leverage their backgrounds in food science and engineering  and their mutual passion for bettering the world - and start their own natural foods company. They sought to create delicious products without sacrificing the nutritional benefits they wanted to provide their customers. They began by developing a product line of four snack bars that not only delight the senses, but are also high in fiber, protein, calcium and contain only all-natural ingredients. Since the original launch of cookie bars, Arico has brought to market a line of cookie pouches and cassava chips. Aricos all-natural snacks embrace \"Mindful Snacking\" to the fullest, containing only the highest-quality, most flavorful and most nutritious ingredients. Not only does Arico create a safe alternative for allergy sufferers, it strives to set an example for the rest of the world through a caring and sensitive business approach to its retail partners and consumers. Cassava, palm or sunflower or safflower oil, evaporated cane juice, sea salt, autolyzed yeast extract, spices, onion powder, garlic powder, leeks, silicon dioxide (natural anti-caking agent), natural flavors, medium chain triglycerides, natural vitamin E to preserve freshness.

We think that selectively choosing fine, naturally delicious ingredients creates better tasting products. And we are certain your tastebuds will agree. Enjoy our naturally delicious, high-quality nut butters, nut butter snacks and organic peanut butter cups for their great taste, unique texture and convenient nutrition. At Justins, we strive to make more than delicious products; we hope to make a difference. To name just a few initiatives: Mindfully Sourced Ingredients, Pollinator Conservation, Hunger Relief Support, Organic and Rainforest Alliance Certified Cocoa...and many more! As we grow, so does our ability to give back. Join us. It all started with a jar. With the help of a simple food processor and the highest quality ingredients available, Justin revolutionized the world of nut butter to create products driven by a passion for delicious taste, unique texture and quality ingredients. First, he created them for his adventures. Now, he makes them for you. As the first nut butter brand to market protein-packed nut butters in single-serve squeeze packs, Justins provides a convenient source of nutrition for an active lifestyle. Available in 7 varieties, squeeze packs are perfect to enjoy on toast, fruit or right out of the pack. So, give your favorite nut butter a squeeze anytime, anywhere and on anything. Whats more perfect than peanut butter and chocolate? By blending his artisanal peanut butter with high quality chocolate, Justin created a better-for-you alternative to the conventional peanut butter cup. 100% organic, Rainforest Alliance-certified, gluten free and delicious. Yup, its how a peanut butter cup should taste. Available in dark, milk, or white chocolate, and miniature-sized if you're adventurous. The story began in 2004 when Justin Gold, a lover of the active lifestyle, moved to Boulder, Colorado in his 20s. In order to fuel his long bike rides, Justin embarked on a mission to create new varieties of nut butter that not only packed the protein, but also tasted great. He began crafting the very first batches of his now-famous, culinary nut butters in his home kitchen. Given that nut butter was a staple in my vegetarian diet, plain old peanut butter just wasnt cutting it. I started grinding my own flavors and an assortment of experimental nut butters began to fill the cabinets. After weeks of hungry roommates stealing my tasty creations, I wrote my name on the jar and Justin's was born. When I first started making nut butter, I didnt overthink whether it was smooth or crunchy, I just made it because it tasted good, that is made with common sense ingredients and fills a lifestyle need. Thats what I continue to do today, focus on making naturally delicious products. Its simple really. Simple, and delicious. Its the creative and collaborative aspect of innovating that makes every day exciting. And, as we grow, we continue to invest in our commitment to corporate consciousness. We have the opportunity to truly be visionaries and develop great tasting products that people love. May contain trace amounts of peanuts and/or tree nuts Dry Roasted Almonds, Organic Palm Fruit Oil.

The Master Chocolatiers of Lindt are experts of this craft. For more than 165 years, Lindt has been developing innovative chocolate recipes with meticulous craftsmanship, resulting in superior tasting, high quality premium chocolate. Lindt Chocolate uses only the finest ingredients, and is one of the few chocolate manufacturers that control the entire production process  from roasting the cacao beans to producing the chocolate. In 1845, confectioner David Sprngli-Schwarz and his inventive son, Rudolf Sprungli-Ammann, owned a small confectionary shop in the Marktgasse of Zurichs Old Town. They dared to try something new- a fashionable new recipe from Italy for manufacturing chocolate in solid form. In 1879, Rodolphe Lindt, one of the most famous chocolate-makers of his day, developed a technique by which he could manufacture chocolate unique to others in aroma and melting characteristics. Lindt used the conche he had invented to produce chocolate with delicate flavor. His melting chocolate soon achieved fame, and contributed significantly to the worldwide reputation of Swiss chocolate. It was in 1899 that Sprnglis private company Chocolat Sprngli acquired the small but famous chocolate factory of Rodolphe Lindt in Berne. This brave step transferred not only the factory but also the manufacturing secrets and the Rodolphe Lindt brand name to the young Sprngli company which now changed its name to Lindt & Sprngli. In 1986, Lindt & Sprngli (USA) Inc., was activated and a manufacturing site and administration building were commissioned in Stratham, New Hampshire where it has expanded and successfully operates today.

The Master Chocolatiers of Lindt are experts of this craft. For more than 165 years, Lindt has been developing innovative chocolate recipes with meticulous craftsmanship, resulting in superior tasting, high quality premium chocolate. Lindt Chocolate uses only the finest ingredients, and is one of the few chocolate manufacturers that control the entire production process  from roasting the cacao beans to producing the chocolate. In 1845, confectioner David Sprngli-Schwarz and his inventive son, Rudolf Sprungli-Ammann, owned a small confectionary shop in the Marktgasse of Zurichs Old Town. They dared to try something new- a fashionable new recipe from Italy for manufacturing chocolate in solid form. In 1879, Rodolphe Lindt, one of the most famous chocolate-makers of his day, developed a technique by which he could manufacture chocolate unique to others in aroma and melting characteristics. Lindt used the conche he had invented to produce chocolate with delicate flavor. His melting chocolate soon achieved fame, and contributed significantly to the worldwide reputation of Swiss chocolate. It was in 1899 that Sprnglis private company Chocolat Sprngli acquired the small but famous chocolate factory of Rodolphe Lindt in Berne. This brave step transferred not only the factory but also the manufacturing secrets and the Rodolphe Lindt brand name to the young Sprngli company which now changed its name to Lindt & Sprngli. In 1986, Lindt & Sprngli (USA) Inc., was activated and a manufacturing site and administration building were commissioned in Stratham, New Hampshire where it has expanded and successfully operates today.

Starting in 1975, the company broadened its focus to include bagged teas and then began to sell a full line of traditional, specialty blend and herbal teas directly to fine restaurants and through a mail order catalog to consumers. Today, Stash Tea Company is one of the largest specialty tea companies in the United States. The company derives its name from an entertaining aspect of tea folklore. In earlier centuries, tea was a valuable commodity traditionally transported by clipper ship. The ships captain often was presented with some of the finest teas for his personal use. This supply was his stash, stowed carefully as his private reserve. Today, the term is still used to denote anything put away carefully because of its preciousness.

Home of America's Best Selling Gummy Worm, Trolli candy has weirdly awesome flavors, weirdly awesome shapes, and weirdly awesome fun.

Weve got a sweet history  but an even richer opportunity for future growth and success is right at our doorstep. Our mission is to take the brands that have been loved for generations to the next level. In 2012, we brought together brands like Trolli, Brachs, Black Forest, Now & Later and Lemonhead.

        "description": "Matcha, which means powdered tea, has been enjoyed for over 800 years. Our premium Ceremonial grade matcha is stone ground in the ancient way to produce the finest quality matcha. Unlike regular green tea leaves, which are removed when brewed, matcha is whisked with water and consumed entirely. This ensures that pure matcha drinkers consume almost 10 times more green tea anti-oxidants, vitamins, minerals and fibers. Pure Matcha is cultivated in the the Nishio region of Japan. Nishio is in the heart of Aichi-prefecture, Japan. Japan's highest quality teas come from Nishio. This area is known as a historic tea cultivating region dating back to the 1200s. Nishio's stable climate, fresh pristine river waters, fertile soil, and remoteness from major urban development foster tea leaves that are more resiliently green and full of nutrients than those found in any other regions of Japan. It is this quality that Nishio Matcha represents in over 60% of all Matcha sold in Japan. Pure Matcha Ceremonial Grade 30g Tin is extremely rare and almost impossible to find on the web or in stores. The freshness is guaranteed! Each 30g tin is sealed to lock in the freshness. All tins are stored in a cold chamber until shipped (also to preserve freshness). If you love healthy flavorful teas, then you are going to love this rare form of tea! 1 30g tin makes approx 16 - 18 cups NOTE: Matcha is not an instant mix. Matcha is 100% pure green tea. You can not stir with a spoon. The Matcha will clump. You must blend or whisk the powder. 100% green tea powder 1: Place 1 to 2 bamboo tea spoons ( 1/2 to 1 tsp.) of Matcha powder in the bowl. 2: Press the whisk down on matcha to break up powder if you do not have a strainer. 3: Add 2 to 3 oz of pre boiling water to the bowl (180F / 80C). Boiling water may not be the most suitable for Matcha and can burn the tea. 4: Using a bamboo whisk: whisk briskly with the motion of making the letter M or W. Simply an up and down motion will do as well. Add more water to taste for preference. Pure Matcha Products inc. All rights reserved.

The convenient form is ideal for baking and cooking - easy to measure, easy to mix, and easy to melt. <strong>Bittersweet Dark Chocolate Couverture Slab &mdash; 70% Cacao</strong> Our 70% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate is a favorite for both eating and baking. With bright fruitiness and a long, smooth finish, it embodies everything we love about cacao. The term 'Couverture' translates to 'covering' and refers to chocolate that is suitable for tempering or enrobing in its finished use. While all Scharffen Berger chocolate can be used as 'couverture', the slabs are sized to facilitate candymaking or decorative shaving. They are scored into five equal sections. <strong>Unsweetened Dark Chocolate Baking Bar &mdash; 99% Cacao</strong> Our 99% Cacao Unsweetened Chocolate adds a new dimension of flavor to classic desserts and other dishes. With a fruit-forward character, a long finish and balanced acidity, this bar is complex, yet remarkably smooth. <strong>Cacao Nibs Pouch (Roasted, Hulled and Crushed Cacao Beans)</strong> Cacao Nibs are perfectly roasted cocoa beans separated from their husks and broken into small bits. They are the essence of chocolate. Nibs add crunchiness and subtle chocolate flavor to baked goods and savory dishes. They make a great substitute for roasted nuts or chocolate chips, without added sweetness. <strong>Sweetened Cocoa Powder</strong> With Scharffen Berger Sweetened Natural Cocoa Powder, it is easy to make delicious hot cocoa and chocolate milk. The only thing we have added to our exceptional cocoa powder is pure cane sugar &mdash; no powdered milk or the alkali used in Dutch-process cocoa. <strong>Unsweetened Cocoa Powder</strong> Developed for baking and beverages, our Natural Cocoa Powder is made from perfectly roasted and well-fermented beans. America's first contemporary artisan chocolate manufacturer, SCHARFFEN BERGER Chocolate Maker set out to craft the richest, most flavorful chocolate by sourcing the best cacao in the world and blending it in small batches using vintage equipment. SCHARFFEN BERGER Chocolate Maker was founded in 1997 by chocolate connoisseur Robert Steinberg and winemaker John Scharffenberger. The pair tested multiple combinations before perfecting a unique blend that highlighted the true flavor of cacao instead of masking it with sugar and other flavors. The result is an array of truly distinctive chocolates with balance and complexity &mdash; not unlike those found in exceptional wines. As the first American \"bean-to-bar\" chocolate manufacturer in over 50 years, SCHARFFEN BERGER Chocolate Maker led this country's contemporary resurgence in artisan chocolate-making. It was also the first chocolate maker to label their chocolate with the percentage of cacao inside. Today, SCHARFFEN BERGER Chocolate Maker travels the world to source the finest cacao. We select the best beans from small sustainable farms in fabled cacao-producing countries: Madagascar, Indonesia, Trinidad, Venezuela, Brazil, Guatemala, Vietnam, Grenada, Paupua New Guinea, Bali, Ghana and Peru. Of the more than 150 samples we taste each year, only a select few are chosen to become SCHARFFEN BERGER Chocolate. Beans from each region are picked for their unique flavor characteristics, and our roasting parameters are specially developed for each origin to bring out the best in each flavor. We blend these freshly roasted beans to produce our signature flavors, balanced and complex, highlighting the true, rich flavors of cacao. This artisan process, honed with a wine-maker's attention to craftsmanship, results in the richest, most flavorful chocolate perfect for your favorite cakes, cookies, desserts and savory recipes.

It was a very convenient food source or a seasoning for other foods that, like it, did not require refrigeration. Obviously, this is not the usual mass produced wet bacon found in most modern supermarkets. This is old fashioned artisinal salt and hickory smoke dry cured bacon; a product created by an old fashioned Cure-Master, Rufus Brown, using age old secret methods dating back over centuries. This is what bacon tasted like, 300 years ago.\n\nThe sweet, salty, and smoky favor of this dry cured Country Bacon is unmatched by the more modern processed bacon. Country Bacon cooks quicker and does not shrink anywhere near as much as regular bacon while cooking. This wonderful nostalgic bacon is a great secret ingredient to cook with, bake cornbread or biscuits with, and take along on camping trips. The aroma of this Country Bacon just frying in a skillet with a couple of eggs is incredible. We sell this Country Dry Cured Bacon in convenient pre-sliced packages, or in a handy 2 Lb. slab.

By the first century AD, soybean cultivation had spread to many countries including Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand and India. In the early 1800s, trade ships returning home from the East introduced soybeans to America. Today many countries around the world depend on soybeans as an important source of dietary protein. Soybeans contain complete plant protein with all the amino acids essential to human nutrition. They rank right up there with meat and dairy products in the protein department, with very little saturated. They also contain calcium and dietary fiber, which are sorely lacking in American diets. Soybeans are a good source of B vitamins and minerals including manganese, phosphorus, and potassium. They are also are rich in isoflavones which are believed to have a significant impact on disease prevention. Soybeans, always a popular natural food, are used in a multitude of ways including tofu, miso, tempeh and soy milk. Cooked soybeans can be used as an ingredient in soups, sauces, salads and stews. You can also add pur?ed soybeans to bread and cake recipes for a nutritional kick.

Cooperatively produced in Murcia along the Mundo and Segura River valleys, Calasparra is a premium grade of Spanish rice. Granted DOP status in 1986, Calasparra is still, to this day, the only such protected rice in the European community. It needs 2 1/2 times as much water as standard Spanish rice, and it holds up very well so there is less danger of having soggy, overcooked rice. It is like Arborio to Italians. In the centuries old tradition, fresh river waters are channeled through the rice fields near the town of Calasparra, and the cooler summer climate of the area results in a slower ripening grain which is harder and slower cooking.

The leaves had gone through a series of special technical treatments before they became able to deliver its health promoting properties with the hot water. The ingredients have been referred by a number of fine publicans around North America for their health benefits to hypertension since early 2009, and the tea has become increasingly popular in Australia with concentrated tea capsules being introduced in 2010. Dus diet plan is officially listed by Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia in 2010 for natural hypertension diet and healthy living. What is Dus Tea? Du's tree belongs to an ancient plant class and is over 2 million years old. Most of them located in North Asia, Europe and North America had been unable to survive the 4th Ice Age, except a small amount in Central China, still found there today. The tree is commonly referred to as The Living Fossil by modern geologists. Modern scientists discovered the leaves of Du's tree to be very rich in powerful, health-promoting nutrients and various minerals. which may possibly carry the answers to the issues of high blood pressure and cholesterol. From the Seller: Du's tea has helped thousands of people regain healthy blood pressure since 2009. The tea works on most types of high blood pressure cases, with the results been seen within first week. However, if your hypertension problem was caused by some very complicated health issues beyond the control of the tea, it is recommended to inquiry your doctor for further assistance on comprehensive medical treatment. We offer a 30 Day Monday Back Guarantee. Remark: Dus Tea contains green ginseng. This ingredient may help increase gastrointestinal motility and promote gentle bowel movements on healthy individuals.

For cooking, where you want to split the beans and/or scrape out the caviar, you should use Grade A Gourmet vanilla beans. \n<br> \n<br> Our beans are \n<b>traditionally cured</b> over several months to ensure that the full flavor of the vanilla bean is developed. We do not sell quick cured vanilla beans where the beans are cured in 7 to 10 days. \n<br> \n<br> These vanilla beans are triple inspected. The first inspection takes place during packing and is for smell, appearance, and mold. The next inspection takes place during vacuum sealing and is for mold and appearance. The final inspection takes place before shipment to ensure that the vacuum seal is intact and that there is no mold. \n<br> \n<br> \n<b>Some facts about vanilla beans:</b> \n<br> \n<br> - Bourbon refers to the formerly named Bourbon Islands (now Reunion) off of Madagascar. Bourbon alcohol is not used in vanilla beans. \n<br> - Vanilla beans are the second most labor intensive spice after saffron. \n<br> - They originated in Mexico. \n<br> - Vanilla beans must be hand pollinated outside of Mexico because the pollinator, the Melipona bee, cannot survive outside of Mexico. \n<br> - When the vanilla orchid blooms, it must be pollinated within 24 hours or else the boom dies and no vanilla pod is produced for that bloom. \n<br> - Vanilla is an orchid, and the beans are the fruit of the orchid. \n<br> - It is the only orchid fruit that we eat. \n<br> - There are over 200 organic compounds in vanilla. Artificial vanilla (vanillin) cannot capture the complexity of natural vanilla. \n<br> - The United States consumes roughly half of all vanilla beans produced in the world. \n<br> Cured vanilla beans. ***Storage*** Triple wrap in zip lock freezer bags immediately upon receipt.  Do not freeze or refrigerate them.  Store in a cool, dark place. ***Homemade Vanilla Extract***\n1) Use 1/4 pound of beans for every quart of extract that you want to make.  2) Chop the beans into 1/2 inch pieces. Slicing is OK, but it is a waste of time and can be very difficult, if not dangerous, with dry extract grade beans.  3) Use inexpensive name brand Vodka 70 to 90 proof  (35 to 45% alcohol).  4) Shake daily for one month.  Voila!  Homemade Vanilla Extract!  When making vanilla extract, you should go by weight, not number of beans, as there can be anywhere from 70 to 250 beans per pound, depending upon the length and quality.  You can try making extract from Madagascar or Tahitian vanilla beans, and you can use extract grade or prime gourmet grade beans.  You may want to filter your finished product. There is no harm in leaving the beans in.  By law, commercial producers of vanilla extract must use roughly a pound of beans for every gallon of extract they produce (one ounce of beans for eight ounces of extract).  Most commercial vanilla extract comes sweetened to help cut the alcohol smell, but it is not needed.  You can do the same by adding some corn syrup or sugar water - about 5% by volume.  How do you know when the extract is done?  Smell is one way, and another way is by the color - it should be a nice deep amber color.  You can't compare the color to what you buy at the store because vanilla extract manufacturers often add coloring agents.  Just like tea bags and coffee grinds, vanilla beans only have so much flavor in them.  After you are done making extract there really isn't much flavor left in them.

Our beans are traditionally cured over several months to ensure that the full flavor of the vanilla bean is developed. We do not sell quick cured vanilla beans where the beans are cured in 7 to 10 days. These vanilla beans are triple inspected. The first inspection takes place during packing and is for smell, appearance, and mold. The next inspection takes place during vacuum sealing and is for mold and appearance. The final inspection takes place before shipment to ensure that the vacuum seal is intact and that there is no mold. Gourmet vanilla beans are primarily used in desserts like creme brulee and vanilla ice cream. They can also be used in exotic main courses like Vanilla Scallops on a Skewer or Turbot with Vanilla, Asparagus Tips, and Chicken Cocoa Grue Sauce. Some facts about vanilla beans: - Bourbon refers to the formerly named Bourbon Islands (now Reunion) off of Madagascar. Bourbon alcohol is not used in vanilla beans. - Vanilla beans are the second most labor intensive spice after saffron. - They originated in Mexico. - Vanilla beans must be hand pollinated outside of Mexico because the pollinator, the Melipona bee, cannot survive outside of Mexico. - When the vanilla orchid blooms, it must be pollinated with 24 hours or else the boom dies and no vanilla pod is produced for that bloom. - Vanilla is an orchid, and the beans are the fruit of the orchid. - It is the only orchid fruit that we eat. - There are over 200 organic compounds in vanilla. Artificial vanilla (vanillin) cannot capture the complexity of natural vanilla. - The United States consumes roughly half of all vanilla beans produced in the world.

It is dried, crushed, and then expressed to remove the oil. This coconut becomes liquid at 76 degrees F; when cooler it is a creamy solid or semi-solid. Some people might call coconut oil, coconut butter but both are the same thing. This oil has a thick texture with no taste and no odor and is suitable for culinary uses as well as soap and skin care products. A percentage of coconut oil in cosmetics is moisturizing; too much of it can be drying. Its saturated nature resists rancidity and makes a very hard soap, while at the same time producing a fluffy lather. Soapmakers usually combine coconut oil with olive, palm, palm kernel or castor oils for an all-vegetable soap. Some soapmakers use between 20% and 30% of a soap batch as coconut oil.",

        "description": "What is Rock Candy?Rock candy is the product of the further refining by recrystallization of pure cane sugar. In fact, it is the purest form of sugar available, because all impurities are excluded as large crystals form. Crystal growth is based on the particular characteristics of sugar (sucrose) chemistry, and cannot be done with the various sugar free substitutes found in the market. How is Rock Candy made? Rock Candy is made by a process of crystallization, the same process that produces quartz and diamonds in nature  with a different ingredient, of course. It is made by breaking apart the sugar (sucrose) molecular crystal lattice and then allowing it to re-form in conditions that produce larger, purer crystals. A hot, saturated solution of cane sugar and water is poured into large tanks. Careful supervision of the cooling process produces the larger crystals, which are then harvested as Rock Candy sticks, strings, or loose crystals.  History of Rock Candy For centuries, Rock Candy has been recognized as having marked therapeutic and preservative qualities. In fact, in the West, sugar was used only as a medicine or preservative until  in the middle of the 18th century - people discovered it made a sweet treat as well. The earliest known date that white sugar was refined was about 200 BC, so it is probable that the further refining into what was later known as sugre candie was at about that time. There are many references to what we now call Rock Candy in literature. There are several references to it in the poems of the Persian poet Jalai-ad-Din Rumi, who lived in Turkey in the middle 1200s. One early English reference in 1584 seems to sum up the virtues of Rock Candy where it is quoted White sugar is not so good for phlegume, as that which is called Sugar Candie. And Shakespeare, in Henry IV, (1596) referred to its therapeutic value as a throat soother for long-winded talkers.

With a mild and sweet flavor, Blonde Coconut Sugar provides a perfect one-to-one replacement to refined white sugar in your favorite recipes and as a sweetener for hot and cold beverages. Nutritionally rich and minimally processed, organic Blonde Coconut Sugar contains important nutrients, is naturally allergen free, and is sustainably produced without the deforestation common to the production of cane and other sugars. <b>A Nutritious Alternative to Refined Sugars</b><br>At 15 calories per one-teaspoon serving, Coconut Sugar has equivalent calories to both refined white sugar (16 calories per one-teaspoon serving) and beet sugar (16 calories per one-teaspoon serving), and significantly fewer calories than high fructose corn syrup (53 calories per one-teaspoon serving). But unlike most other sugars, Coconut Sugar offers a rich nutritional content that includes magnesium, potassium, zinc, iron, B vitamins, and amino acids (including glutamine). Coconut Sugar is also naturally free from allergens including gluten, is vegan, GMO-free, and Kosher certified. <b>A Sustainable Choice</b><br>Madhava Organic Blonde Coconut Sugar is sourced from sustainable organic producers in Indonesia. It is an organic, unrefined sweetener that is derived from the nectar of coconut palm tree blossoms, or buds. The nectar is boiled to evaporate the water and the remaining concentrated nectar is crystallized into sugar. Coconut palms produce an average of 50 to 75 percent more sugar per acre than sugar cane and use one-fifth of the natural resources. Coconut Palm trees can produce nectar and fruit for decades, making it a sustainably harvested crop that does not contribute to deforestation. Coconut palms are not genetically modified like the majority of conventional domestic sugar beets are. <b>About Madhava Natural Sweeteners</b><br>Madhava is privately owned and operated company, dedicated to providing natural and healthy alternatives to highly processed, refined sugars, and artificial sweeteners. Founded in 1972 in Boulder, Colorado, Madhava's name derives from the Sanskrit word meaning \"Born of Honey\" or \"Born of Light\". Madhava sources its honeys, agave, and coconut products from sustainable, organic sources and small, family-owned beekeepers. Dedicated to providing the highest quality natural sweeteners available, Madhava is one of the first companies to make Coconut Sugar widely available in the U.S. <table cellpadding=\"10\"> <tr><td colspan=\"1\" valign=\"center\" style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size:20px; font-weight:bold; padding:12px; background-color:#526f35\"><font color=\"ffffff\">Try Madhava Organic Blonde Coconut Sugar in These and Other Recipes:</font></td></tr> <tr><td height=\"149\"><img align=\"top\" border=\"0\" height=\"149\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/grocery/detail-page/madhava/B005HGOIQ4-2-rec.jpg\" width=\"225\" /> </td></tr><tr><td><b>Roll Out Shape Cookies:</b><br>Serves 9</td></tr><tr> <td>Ingredients:<br>3 cups all-purpose flour<br>3/4 teaspoon baking powder<br>1/4 teaspoon salt<br>2 sticks unsalted butter (room temperature)<br>1 cup Blonde Coconut Sugar<br>1 egg<br>1 tablespoon milk<br>1 teaspoon vanilla Beat butter and sugar together until light and fluffy with a hand mixer.

        "description": "We're experts in coffee agriculture and roasting but we're also great friends with our partner farmers. We jointly develop a long-term plan to maintain and improve upon the quality of their coffee crop year after year while also focusing on environmental and social responsibility on their farms. Our coffee is strictly premium, Arabica beans grown at high altitudes of 3000 ft. or higher. All of our coffee is also 100% shade grown under a canopy of native trees. High-altitude, shade-grown coffee makes a more complex and delicious cup of coffee. Our coffee is picked by hand so that only the ripest, red cherry is harvested. It's then processed with techniques that result in the highest quality coffee bean. Our first roaster was trained by Alfred Peet who founded Peet's Coffee. From him, we learned the nuances and artistry to coax the maximum flavor from each unique coffee and blend. Since then, we have spent over 30 years perfecting and improving upon this technique. Every day we marry this experience and state-of-the-art technology into an art form to produce not only the very best possible flavor profile from each coffee, but to do it consistently every time. With any Rogers Family gourmet coffee brand, you'll enjoy a premium cup of coffee perfected over 3 decades. Our San Francisco Bay Coffee brand offers you outstanding quality and value with an unparalleled commitment to sustainable agriculture and trade. We offer a rich assortment of premium gourmet coffee, as well as exotic single-origin coffees from Central America and Africa and a great lineup of flavored coffee. Your purchase of Rogers' coffees and teas help us fund our \"Community Aid\" program that helps to break the cycle of poverty in the towns where we buy our coffee and tea. Through Community Aid, we've built schools, worker housing, medical clinics, and day care centers as well as funded scholarships, teachers, and doctors' salaries.

The low viscosity makes these chips perfect for most baking applications, including molding pralines, hollow figurines, fillings and ganaches, and chocolate decorating. Super easy to weigh and melt. Callebaut chocolate is made with fine cocoa beans, natural bourbon vanilla and 100% pure cocoa butter, and they're one of the rare chocolate makers that still selects, roasts and grinds its own cocoa beans. The beans are roasted in their entire shell, to protect them and keep in all the aromas and subtleties. This yields a more intense, more complex and deeper cocoa flavor, unmistakably Callebaut.

        "description": "Mediterranean or Stone Pine Nuts (pinus pinea) are the finest quality pine nuts. They are extremely hard to find in the United States. Their flavor is complex, yet lighter and more delicate than the more common, widely available Chinese, Korean or Mexican pine nuts which are harvested from a different species of pine trees. All pine nuts have exceptional nutritional value. They are good sources of vitamin K1, vitamin E2, and the minerals zinc, non-heme iron, phosphorus and manganese. Mediterranean pine nuts, however, provide a particularly high content of excellent quality protein. This feature makes them especially useful as a nutritional supplement for athletes or anyone who has a greater than average protein requirement. They are also useful for anyone who wants to add nutrient-rich calories to their diet without adding excessive fat. At 34 percent protein by weight, Mediterranean pine nuts are richer in protein than any other plant food, including soybeans (10%), sesame seeds (18%), sunflower seeds (21%) and even hemp seeds (33%). Mediterranean pine nuts are lower in calories than other pine nuts and have a favorable omega-3 to omega-6 ratio, almost 10 times higher than other pine nuts. Pignolia are more expensive than other nuts and seeds, but their nutritional profile makes them a valuable addition to the diet. How do you tell the difference between Mediterranean and other pine nuts? Most commonly available pine nuts are cone-shaped with dark coloration at the smaller end, whereas those from the Stone Pine are long, with an even diameter. Enjoy them as a topping for your salad or soup, mix them into cooked vegetable dishes or process them with fresh herbs into pesto. They are also good just by themselves!

        "description": "La Tourangelle Avocado Oil is 100% pure, all-natural and handcrafted from premium avocados. Avocado oil is processed on equipment very similar to those used to process extra virgin olive oil. The avocado pulp is first expeller-pressed usually using a centrifuge. It is then lightly filtered and \"polished\" using another centrifuge. It takes from 1520 avocados to make 1 (one) 250 ml/8 ounce tin. The result is a beautiful, emerald green oil with high level of monounsaturated fats that will bring a delicious, light fruity flavor to your dishes. La Tourangelle Avocado Oil, like La Tourangelle Olive and Hazelnut oil, contains oleic acid, a monounsaturated fat that may help to lower cholesterol. In one study of people with moderately high cholesterol levels, individuals who ate a diet high in avocados showed clear health improvements. After a few days on the diet that included avocados, they had significant decreases in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, along with an increase in health promoting HDL cholesterol. The purity of La Tourangelle Avocado Oil makes it also an ideal partner to moisturizing your skin and hair. The skin absorbs it quickly without leaving residues. It has a light weight thats easily absorbed into the hair and scalp to moisturize. La Tourangelle is one of few remaining oil mills keeping a time-honored French heritage of roasting and pressing nut kernels into delicious oils. We are a family-owned company whose mastery of oil production is the fruit of passion, integrity, and pride. We strive to be the best artisan oil producer, dedicated to making carefully crafted, sustainable, natural products. With artisan care, we extract the seeds' essence and hidden natural treasures to create amazing products that bring delight in the kitchen and well being for the body.

They come with a 3 inch net pot, just like the one in the picture, moss appropriate for carnivorous plant soil loosely packed, and a detailed full page caresheet, written by an experienced Venus Flytrap grower specifically designed for beginners, explaining how to take care of Venus Flytraps. All you will need is a bowl or saucer to hold the Venus Flytrap's pot that it comes with and a little bit of water, a gallon or so of reverse osmosis or distilled water, and a sunny window or a place in the yard to put your Venus Flytrap's pot in. Humidity domes and year round warm weather are not necessary. Don't be fooled by other offers for Venus Flytraps that have them arrive in or with terrariums or humidity domes. These type of plants have strong light requirements and it is a myth that they need high humidity. The truth is that Venus Flytrap setups with terrariums or humidity domes almost always cause these types of plants to eventually die. They need to be grown in open air with containers that allow air to get into their soil and there should be little to block or diffuse their lighting. Venus Flytraps take about 2-3 years from seed to reach a decent size. A kit with Venus Flytrap seeds is not going to quickly turn into a Venus Flytrap about the size of the one offered in this listing.

Simply combine some fresh veggies, protein and herb, roll them up and voila! Karen Cheng from San Francisco, CA and Thao Nguyen from Vietnam and Australia built Star Anise Foods (SAF) - //staranisefoods.com/ - from their love of Vietnamese noodle soups, particularly Pho, a traditional, healthy rice noodle soup. SAF is a newly founded San Francisco, California-based, woman-owned all natural dry foods company focused on bringing Vietnamese noodles soups to the US market. SAF's passion is to create sustainable and socially responsible opportunities for women in Vietnam with a singular focus to produce wholesome and natural products that encourage a healthy lifestyle in the US. Our first product, Happy Pho, developed from a traditional recipe of Thao's grandparents in the 1920s, combines noodles made of brown rice and green tea with a spice packet of all natural/organic spices.At 6 months pregnant, Karen travelled internationally to Vietnam to meet her partner Thao in June 2009 to start their company. They focused, worked 16-18 hour days, made a lot of Pho and launched their first generation of nutritious Vietnamese noodle soup products which should land on shelves of Northern California Whole Foods Stores in early 2010. A mom 'to be' in a few days, Karen is still cooking passionately in her San Francisco kitchen while her partner Thao continues to forge ahead their desire to strengthen and advance women and farmer enterprises. This dynamic dual has crazy passion for noodles but equally important, they want to change how food is produced and share their wholesome products with you.

Their charming personalities, minimal care, and lack of soil make them an ideal way to bring a little piece of nature into your living space and brighten any room. Their uniqueness also makes them a perfect gift that will leave a lasting impression on any lucky recipient. Air Plants (Tillandsia) get their common name from the fact they don't require soil. They are epiphytes, which attach to other plants or trees for support. Their roots are only used to anchor themselves and are normally removed during cultivation for aesthetics. They are not parasitic, instead they gather micro nutrients from the air and water in structures called trichomes on their leaves. As the plant dries the trichomes take on a white powder look. After watering the plant will return to a vibrant green. Air Plants must dry fully between watering because they are susceptible to rot if left wet to long. These Air Plants will only bloom once, but after the bloom they can form up to 12 \"Pups\", or offspring, at their base. The main plant will slowly be on its way out, but the Pups will continue to thrive and will separate when mature. Air Plants prefer filtered sunlight as their natural home is under tree canopy. This makes them perfect house plants.

It is recommended that INSTANT CLEARJEL be thoroughly blended with sugar or other dry ingredients before it is added to liquids in order to prevent lumping and to insure smoothness. The presence of sugar acts to control the rate of the hydration of the starch. INSTANT CLEARJEL will begin to swell or thicken as soon as it is added to water, milk or juices; it will impart a smooth, short texture when fully hydrated. The viscosity will increase slightly upon heating. It has excellent heat and acid resistance and can be used in acid containing foods and in those applications where heating is required. INSTANT CLEARJEL also has good cold temperature storage stability making it particularly well suited for refrigerated and frozen foods. Store in a cool, dry place. We do not recommend refrigeration or freezing. <b>Hoosier Hill Farm</b> is located in America's heartland of northeast Indiana.

We jointly develop a long-term plan to maintain and improve upon the quality of their coffee crop year after year while also focusing on environmental and social responsibility on their farms. Our coffee is strictly premium, Arabica beans grown at high altitudes of 3000 ft. or higher. All of our coffee is also 100% shade grown under a canopy of native trees. High-altitude, shade-grown coffee makes a more complex and delicious cup of coffee. Our coffee is picked by hand so that only the ripest, red cherry is harvested. It's then processed with techniques that result in the highest quality coffee bean. Our first roaster was trained by Alfred Peet who founded Peet's Coffee. From him, we learned the nuances and artistry to coax the maximum flavor from each unique coffee and blend. Since then, we have spent over 30 years perfecting and improving upon this technique. Every day we marry this experience and state-of-the-art technology into an art form to produce not only the very best possible flavor profile from each coffee, but to do it consistently every time. With any Rogers Family gourmet coffee brand, you'll enjoy a premium cup of coffee perfected over 3 decades. Our Organic Coffee Co. brand offers you outstanding quality and value with an unparalleled commitment to sustainable agriculture and trade. We offer a rich assortment of premium gourmet coffee, as well as exotic single-origin coffees from Central America and Africa and a great lineup of flavored coffee. Your purchase of Rogers' coffees and teas help us fund our \"Community Aid\" program that helps to break the cycle of poverty in the towns where we buy our coffee and tea. Through Community Aid, we've built schools, worker housing, medical clinics, and day care centers as well as funded scholarships, teachers, and doctors' salaries.

Over mixing will cause breads to rise irregularly forming an odd shaped dense loaf. Dough conditioner can help to produce a consistent finished product that is lighter and well shaped. Dough conditioner can go a long way towards making your finished product look better, taste better, and last longer. Most commercial bakers use dough conditioners in modest amounts to improve the texture and appearance of their breads, pastries, and even pizza doughs.

Inspired by her son and encouraged by her husband, she put aside her career as an emergency physician to create great tasting foods for people with modified diets. She started by taking her mothers time tested recipes and substituted her own gluten free flour blend. Next she meticulously experimented until she baked great tasting cookies without milk, butter or eggs. Most importantly, she knew the only way to make products in a protected environment and prevent unwanted ingredients such as peanuts or tree nuts was to control the process from start to finish. She has put all of her efforts into creating a dedicated bakery where her vision is now a reality. Today, Lucy's cookies stand as proof that no one ever has to be denied a good cookie. Every crispy, crunchy Lucy's cookie is baked without wheat, gluten, milk, eggs, peanuts or tree nuts. But you'd never know it. They taste delicious. Today, Dr. Lucy continues to advocate for people with food allergies and special diets. Her vision unfolds daily with increasing demand for her yummy cookies and enthusiastic support from dedicated customers. Made from natural ingredients using no preservatives or trans-fat, and high quality ingredients are used in a carefully controlled bakery to be sure the products meet tight allergen testing criteria. Lucys has four classic flavors: chocolate chip, oatmeal, sugar and cinnamon. 100 to 120 calories per serving. Vegan and Kosher Pareve certified.

The origin of the word 'chocolate' likely comes from the Nahuatl (ancient Aztec) word xocolatl meaning 'bitter water,' as the Aztecs traditionally drank unsweetened chocolate during their royal and religious ceremonies. A native plant of Mexico, Central and South America, cacao is believed to have been introduced to Europe in the 16th century by Cortez, the Spanish conquistador. Two hundred years later in England, John Cadbury created the first modern chocolate bar by adding refined sugar and milk. Today, they return to cacao's countries of origin to create bars that respect native people, endangered ecosystems and modern taste buds. Ingredients: Cocoa liquor, cocoa butter, raw cane sugar, vanilla. Organic and fair trade Cocoa: 85% minimum Made on equipment shared with milk, hazelnuts, almonds and soy. From a fine single origin cacao, this bar has attractive earth, toffee and stone scents on the nose; a creamy mouth feel for a dark bar, with a light and balanced mid-mouth; floral, cherry and coffee flavors, caramel base notes, and nutty cocoa highlights. This is quite the approachable dark bar. If you like to lurk in the dark, this is the bar for you. The deep, fruity intensity of Dark Blackout reflects the rainforest from which it hails. Fortaleza sits at the edge of the Ecuadorian coast, where the world's richest soil and the shade of the forest canopy create an ideal environment for native cacao.

Delicious, naturally flavored water can now be made at home or on the go with our portable liquid drink mix bottles. <br> <br>To use, flip-open the cap. Point downwards directly into your water. And squeeze 1 second per serving in 8-ounces of water (squeeze longer to add more flavor)! Each portable bottle of Stur makes 20 8-ounce drinks  with 0 sugar, 0 calories, and 100% Vitamin C per serving. <br> <br>The Stur brand is about helping others to love water naturally. Stur was born while my wife was pregnant with our twin girls. The doctor had recommended she drink 8-10 glasses of water a day. But like most Americans, she wasn't drinking even half of that! So I started looking for healthy ways to flavor her water. I went to the store and searched the drink mixes, but found that they were all made with artificial chemicals that we didn't feel comfortable putting in my wife's body. Finally I asked a food scientist friend to help me create a liquid blend of natural fruit flavors and natural stevia leaf extract to squeeze in water. It took us over a year and hundreds of different formulations to land upon a blend that tasted better than most bottled sugary drinks (and we're still tinkering to perfect it)! I called our special blend \"Stur\" and proudly wrote on our hand-drawn label that it had 0 calories, 0 sugar, essential vitamins, and NO artificial sweeteners, colors or flavors. (That initial label was hand-drawn by yours truly, and by popular demand, it has since been replaced with a more professional one!). Just like so many others, I hope you love Stur as much as we have put love into making it. If for any reason you aren't satisfied, just let us know --- we will make it right.

Each flower of the crocus sativus has only three pistils, and these must be picked by hand. Over 70,000 flowers are required to yield 1 pound of saffron. It has been used since classical times as a flavoring in food and wine. It is an effective stimulant and digestive, increasing the flow of saliva and digestive juices. The very best saffron is grown in Valencia, Spain. Unlike some saffron, ours is made from the full stems and not ground-up pieces that can easily be adulterated. The price of saffron is dependent on its coloring power (graded categories i to iv with i being the strongest). The select is category 1 and the sierra is category ii.

        "description": " Viva Naturals Organic Coconut Oil gives you an easy, wonderful way to add flavor to your diet, and boost your skin and hair regime with the power of MCTs, immune boosters, and compounds found in coconuts. The Viva Naturals Difference Viva Naturals doesn&rsquo;t source its coconuts from large-scale farms where machines pop thousands of coconuts off the trees every day. Instead, Viva Naturals contracts with local farmers, who hand pick coconuts in idyllic, fertile mountain regions in the Philippines. These succulent coconuts are then cold-pressed at low temperatures using our proprietary extraction method, preserving vitamins, minerals and MCTs. What Makes Viva Naturals Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil So Superior? The Best Taste: Viva Naturals traveled the world in order to find the best-tasting coconuts. After hundred of hours, we discovered that the most delicious coconuts are grown in the fertile soils of the Philippines. With each jar of oil, you&rsquo;ll taste the rich, silky smooth texture that is derived from these &ldquo;cream of the crop&rdquo; coconuts. Grown in a Pristine Natural Environment: Our farms are miles away from the nearest city and situated with among wide nature preserve. This means there&rsquo;s virtually no pollution or pesticide runoff. Specialized Extraction: Viva Naturals cold presses each coconut within a few hours of being harvested using our proprietary extraction method. Rather than storing the coconuts in a warehouse for weeks or even months, the quick turnover crystallizes nearly all of the MCTs and antioxidants in the oil. See nutrition information for total fat and saturated fat content. An allergy to coconuts is rare; however, customers who are allergic to coconuts may experience contact allergic dermatitis to coconut products. Food allergies are due to the inability to digest proteins, such as gluten (found in wheat), casein (found in dairy), protein found in tree nuts, etc. Coconut protein is found in the meat of the coconut, not in the oil. This product contains 100% Extra Virgin Coconut Oil only. No other ingredients are present that would not be suitable for use or consumption A warning is not required as the coconut oil itself is free of allergens. . This product is labelled to United States standards and may differ from similar products sold elsewhere in its ingredients, labeling and allergen warnings Can be taken as a dietary supplement, used as a versatile cooking oil or as part of your natural skin and hair care routine. 100% Organic, extra-virgin, cold-pressed coconut oil. For Dietary Supplementation: Take 1-4 tablespoons per day for best results. For Cooking and Baking: Excellent for cooking up to 350 F (177C) and makes an excellent dairy-free substitute for butter in baking. For Skin & Hair Care: For skin care, apply topically as an intensive moisturizing lotion. For use an intensive hair mask, submerge the coconut oil jar in warm water until liquefied. Apply 1 tablespoon to dry hair and let sit for 1-2 hours, shampooing thoroughly afterwards.

It has been used for centuries as a digestive and elimination aid, for energy, sexual vitality, skin and eye health, as a lubricant for the joints and for alkalizing the blood. Comprised of full spectrum short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids, Ghee contains Omega 3 and Omega 9 essential fatty acids along with vitamins A, D, E and K. Our Ghee is one of the highest natural sources of CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid) because we use only the highest quality organic butter of pastured cows. Our golden Ghee has a delicious caramelized and nutty taste that will enhance the flavor of any culinary creation.

The name derives from the Latin terra merita meritorious earth referring to the color of ground turmeric which resembles a mineral pigment. In many languages turmeric is simply named as yellow root. Spice description turmeric is the rhizome or underground stem of a ginger-like plant. It is usually available ground, as a bright yellow, fine powder. The whole turmeric is a tuberous rhizome, with a rough, segmented skin. The rhizome is yellowish-brown with a dull orange interior that looks bright yellow when powdered. Bouquet: earthy and slightly acrid. Flavor: warm and aromatic with a bitter undertone. Preparation and storage turmeric is mostly used in ground form. The powder will maintain its coloring properties indefinitely though the flavor will diminish over time so buy in moderation. Store in airtight containers, out of sunlight. Culinary uses : in India it is used to tint many sweet dishes. Apart from its wide use in Moroccan cuisine to spice meat, particularly lamb, and vegetables, its principal place is in curries and curry powders. It is used in many fish curries, possibly because it successfully masks fishy odors. When used in curry powders, it is usually one of the main ingredients, providing the associated yellow color. Attributed medicinal properties turmeric is a mild digestive, being aromatic, a stimulant and a carminative. An ointment base on the spice is used as an antiseptic . Turmeric water is an Asian cosmetic applied to impart a golden glow to the complexion. Cur cumin has been shown to be active against staphylococcus aureus (pus-producing infections).

Beware of companies bottling artificial syrup sourced from outside of South America. Get our highest quality Yacon with our Satisfaction guarantee before it runs out!</b> Our Yacon Syrup is: - Sourced and farmed from the Yacon fields in Peru - - Premium grade 100% pure all natural with no added preservatives - - SATISFACTION GUARANTEED - <b>Safety Considerations </b> Studies have shown that taking too much Yacon Syrup can have some adverse effects on the digestive system, mainly in the form of gas, bloating and discomfort. Because the active ingredient is essentially a sugar, once it hits the intestines, it can produce a lot of gas, therefore causing flatulence, cramping and bloating. Some people have stated certain adverse side effects with increased bowel movements, particularly due to the fibre content within the Yacon Syrup. While this is a positive factor for most people, for some with sensitive intestines and digestion, caution should be exercised. In order to prevent this, take only about 1-2 teaspoons 30 to 60 minutes before a meal and have no more than 4-5 teaspoons in a day.

Its super easy to work with, its quite tasty, it has a nice texture, and it makes one 14 pizza or two 10 pizzas! Start out by preheating the oven to 425 F with our pizza stone to get a slightly crispier crust.

Our vanilla bean powder is made by grinding the whole vanilla pod and then sifting out some of the pod material from the seeds. This process helps to bring out the natural oils and flavor of the vanilla beans. Use in the place of extracts for a pure vanilla flavor. \n<br> \n<br> \n<b>Key Nutrition Benefits of Terrasoul Superfoods Organic Vanilla Bean Powder:</b> \n<br> Vanilla Bean contains many trace minerals such like potassium, iron, manganese and copper.

A proprietary process was used to provide uniform distribution of MCT, preserve aroma and enhance rich taste. MCTs are saturated fatty acids that provide energy for the brain. LipiX uses a proprietary process to ensure uniform blending. MCTs are metabolized very rapidly without the need for additional enzyme unlike longer chain fatty acids like oilve oil. MCTs form ketone bodies (a source of energy) in the liver which releases them into the bloodstream for use by other organs including brain, visual system etc. Try once and notice the difference. Please research Medium Chain Triglyceride on the web to find out more. Specially blended freeze dried Coffee with medium chain triglycerides by a proprietary process PLEASE DO NOT USE STYROFOAM OR PLASTIC CUP FOR INSTANT EDGE COFFEE. Add two tea spoons of Instant Edge to hot or cold water, stir and enjoy. Add a sweetener and/ or creamer  if desired. Adding a creamer will boost the ketogenic property. MCT oil consumption may cause gastrointestinal discomfort initially. If that happens please use Instant Edge along with a food to avoid the discomfort.
