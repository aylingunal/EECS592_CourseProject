A serving of 1/4 teaspoon will provide approixmately 3 mg of iodine, or 20 times the RDA. Is that safe? Dr. David Brownstein, MD, thinks so. He regularly prescribes 6-12 mg of iodine as a maintenance dose, and up to 50 mg to \"load\" the body until it reaches sufficiency and excretes 90%. In his book, \"Iodine, Why You Need It\", he carefully analyzes and disproves the seven common concers with using iodine above the RDA, showing in case after case history that the whole body benefits while safely excreting excess iodine in the urine. We also know Asian cultures with high consumption of seafood and seaweed, average well above 150 mcg of iodine per day and show no ill effects, with markedly longer lifespans. If you are concerned about too much iodine, please consult your health practitioner. Otherwise, enjoy the wealth of nutrition this kelp brings you from the deep Atlantic.
